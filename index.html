        <p>Hi! My name is Tyler Nelson, and I am a former BYU-Idaho student. I am
            taking extra education to further my employability. I have Aspergers Syndrome
            and I have a love for several geeky topics, but have particular soft spots
            for animation, gaming (both tabletop and video gaming), and I also like
            to garden and put model trains in my garden.
        </p>

        <p>I'm from Washington State, and one of our most famous events is the eruption of Mt. Saint Helens. I wasn't
            alive for it, but my Mother had to stay in the house for two or three weeks after the eruption.</p>
